Jun 25: allocated memory for array of stats(stats.c)
	finished basic math caculation of min_delay, avg_delay and Max_Delay
Jun 28: Completed stats.C, started reviewing Semophere and bbuffer.c
	// int    sem_close(sem_t *);
	// int    sem_destroy(sem_t *);
	// int    sem_getvalue(sem_t *, int *);
	// int    sem_init(sem_t *, int, unsigned int);
	// sem_t *sem_open(const char *, int, ...);
	// int    sem_post(sem_t *);
	// int    sem_trywait(sem_t *);
	// int    sem_unlink(const char *);
	// int    sem_wait(sem_t *);

Completed knowledge on these build in function in Semophere.h
	http://brickos.sourceforge.net/docs/APIs/html-c/semaphore_8h.html
We only used 
	// int    sem_init(sem_t *, int, unsigned int);
	// int    sem_wait(sem_t *);
	// int    sem_post(sem_t *);
We used sem_init to intialize our semaphores
We used sem_post and sem_wait for acting like a lock with mutex

July 1: completed locks and critical section
	 completed bbuffers
	 Started doing candykids
	 completed basic statement extraction steps 1- 3
July 3:  completed steps 4-10, detected few errors in stats.C, bbuffer.c
         fixing critical section and math caculation of bbuffer.c and stats.c

July 4: continue doing what we are doing on July 3

July 5: Fixed the problem and changing stats_display in stats.c to fit more like sample output
	added more comments and printf to look like sample output

July 8: Fixed final few error in our code and completed all free for valgrind checking


	Still trying to fix few conor case that have a delay of thousands.
